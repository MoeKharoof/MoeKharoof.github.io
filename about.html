        <p>Hello there, My name is <a href="https://youtu.be/IGNPRGJ8XO8"> Mohammad Kharoof</a>. I am a 20 year old computer 
            engineering student in <a href = "https://www.aus.edu/">the AUS</a>. 
            I live in Sharjah next to Al Qasba. I love solving problems by creating and desining carefully engineered solutions. 
            I usually do that by coding, 3D modelling and printing things. I also enjoy play MMO RPGs with my friends, 
            as you can see I am an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCQMIZkevBc">Akali</a> main. I am very interested in embedded systems
            and IoT applications since it was my passion ever since I was a child with a broken arm. (Yes, I wanted to replace it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCQMIZkevBc">Cyber-punk</a> style).
            My first project was a robotic wolf prototype inspired from <a href = "https://digimon.fandom.com/wiki/MetalGarurumon">digimon adventure</a>. It is under progress and I am so proud of it. 
            In case you have not noticed yet, the color scheme is based on the crest of friendship that Yamato carries. When it comes to music, I am a man of culture.
            It depends on the current situation we are in. You can see me listening to some rock music and then some cheerful Japanese openinings.
            I truly love nature with all of its different aspects except for tomatoes. <a href = "https://youtu.be/c2gq4IwIc_s">I really hate tomatoes</a> and their relatives. In fact, I wish they have never existed.
